You have data buried in log files.  Need to identify some trends?  Need to 
extract, summarize, and analyze numbers included in the log entries?  Want 
something quick and easy without the need for an entire infrastructure for log 
analysis?  That's what logstats is for.

logstats reads in log files -- text files where each line starts with a 
timestamp.  You specify regular expressions describing the events and/or 
numeric data you're interested in.  logstats aggregates statistics about the 
events by regular time interval -- a time series histogram.  By default it 
prints the data to the screen; if you have matplotlib installed it can plot it, 
too.  It can also compute overall statistics in addition to the time series 
statistics.

logstats is a standalone, command-line script, written in python, with no other 
external dependencies other than matplotlib (and that's only needed for extra 
plotting in addition to the default text output).
